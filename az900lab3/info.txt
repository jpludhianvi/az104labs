Configure BackendNSG Rules:

Repeat the steps to add a rule in BackendNSG to allow traffic on port 1433 for SQL Server.
Verification
Verify Subnet Configuration:

Ensure that all subnets (Frontend, Backend, Database) are created within LabVNet.
Check that FrontendNSG is associated with the Frontend subnet.
Check that BackendNSG is associated with the Backend subnet.
Verify NSG Rules:

Verify that FrontendNSG has a rule allowing HTTP traffic on port 80.
Verify that BackendNSG has a rule allowing SQL Server traffic on port 1433.
